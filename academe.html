                        <strong>Socialization</strong> is the process through which people learn and acquire the characteristics of the social group to which they belong is called socialization. The socialization of individuals enables the preservation and sustainability of the characteristics, values and social norms because these are taught and transmitted from one generation to another. School plays a big role in gender socialization since it is one that influences every child’s socialization.

                    <p>
                    Gender role differentiations are influenced by school for several reasons, and sometimes it contributes to how they see each other. School is the place where gender gets deeply established in the way boys and girls think and behave with each other. And if you condone or ignore any violence, that is going to assume a major dimension later in life because it is seen as something acceptable.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                    “Many of the socialization processes that lead to gender differentiated outcomes, including gender segregation, are not well understood. In addition, more work is needed to identify effective means to prevent and minimize gender biased attitudes and behaviour. Future research is also needed to document the experiences of children who do not conform to traditional gender roles (e.g., children with same-sex parents or who are transgendered).”

                        The school has developed programs for people, especially students to be gender sensitive and to promote gender equality
                        by adding “Gender and Society” into its curriculum. By this, we’re being taught about how society may affect someone’s gender.
                        We were also taught how transgender people are being treated before—how they were being secluded because of them being different
                        were not welcomed by our society, until now that there are laws to protect them and programs that will help the rest of the
                        people understand them.
