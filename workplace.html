                <p>
                The workforce in the Philippines has been shaped due time. Before, only men can study up to college where they can study medicine, engineering and other courses that “may seem hard” for women to take. Only women from rich families can take what they want. If you're from a poor family, the best you can get if you want to finish college is by teaching- which is highly dominated by women even before. Thanks to people who fought for our freedom, everyone has equal opportunities to choose what they want to be, and that translates to what's happening in the present. Many men are taking education courses, and many women are taking engineering courses. Of course, there are limitations. Like before, labor intensive jobs like construction were dominated by men.                 </p>

                  <p>
There is a slight difference between men and women in our labor market. The cause of it is our norm, which is we'll try to break through it. In a family, especially when there's a toddler, we are used to seeing more women handling the job than men. This is something that is passed from generations to generations. We are used to it, and we are just following it unconsciously because of our mindset that “if someone is better in this area, let them be with it” which is a sad truth that is happening to us. This problem cannot be solved by the government, or any movement by the GAD as this topic is between partners and their plans for their family.                  </p>
